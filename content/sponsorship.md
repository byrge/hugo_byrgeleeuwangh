Hi,

You can buy a week-long sponsorship for my blog site. This is the best way to promote your related product or service to my audience of Data Geeks interested in Analytics, implementation tips, debugging and collecting quality data.

As a sponsor what do you get:

* A display ad on every blog page of the site, including the homepage, all week long.

* A post from you, the sponsor will appear in the RSS feed at the start of the week.

* At the end of the week, I’ll also post an item thanking and linking to the feed sponsor.


About my audience:

* Typical weekday web page views: 80,000–100,000.

* Estimated monthly web page views: 2.5 million.

* Estimated RSS feed subscribers: Over 200,000.

* Sponsorship is exclusive. Only one sponsor per week.
